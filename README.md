## Jupyter Notebook

There is a log book to understand the details of data. Neural Networks and Random Forest Techniques are applied with various experiments to obtain a degree of better accuracy.


## Conlcusion

In our case where we have ten classes of different traffic, RF will do it well for each class resulting in some accuracy for resemblance with a class and we can classify the flow to highest scoring trees. Problem in this case is choosing a higher estimators for proper validaiton score. for kind of data where as Neural Networks are universal approximators works better for forecasting and Image processing problems.
